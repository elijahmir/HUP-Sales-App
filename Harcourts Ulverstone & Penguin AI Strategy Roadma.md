FUTURE STATE

2

Who

AI AGENT PROCESSOR

The agent records the appraisal visit using any available technology, such as
a Plaud ai device, which later logs all information into the system. The tool
can also analyze how the agent conducts the conversation and provide
tailored training on best practices. To begin with a simpler approach, step
one is to use an AI agent connected to OneDrive. The agent or PA Nicole
scans the form and uploads it, which triggers the automation to extract the
information and log it into the system. Once agents become comfortable
with this process, step two can gradually be introduced, which involves

AI Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a staged approach to integrate Artificial Intelligence AI and
automation into HUPʼs operations, focusing on maximizing Return on Investment
ROI and streamlining labor-intensive, repetitive tasks.

Stage 1
Develop the following agents during this stage:

1.  MAINTENANCE REQUEST AI (ROI: 294%, Annual Savings: 9K

This can be launched immediately through TAPI. It is simple, fast, and
provides quick value. This gives your AI Engineer early confidence while
allowing the team to feel the impact of AI in a safe and predictable context.

2.  APPRAISAL PROCESS STEP 1 OCR (ROI: 16%, Annual Savings: 0.5K

This initiative is low effort and simple to deliver. It relies mainly on basic
OCR with minimal business brain logic, which your engineer has already
touched during the initial setup. It also lays essential groundwork for future
workflows.
Once live, the team can use it for a period of time and gather real insights
that will shape Step 2, which adds the recording component. Omnichannel
capability is not required at this stage. The aim is to establish a light first
step that anchors the broader multi step appraisal workflow.

16

Tech Stack Progression

- Voice agent: not used yet
- Text agent SMS/WhatsApp): not used yet
- Business brain Supabase): utilized
- Omnichannel Chatwoot): not used yet

Stage 2
Develop the following agents during this stage:

3.  LISTING CREATIVE Only Automation or A (ROI: 658%, Annual Savings:

6.5K
Easy to implement since the team already uses Canva templates and
reviews copy with vendors. This helps your engineer gain confidence in
workflow automation with canva templates.

4.  JUST LISTED SOCIAL MEDIA POSTING AI or Automation) (ROI: 279%,

Annual Savings: 3K
This is another simple repetitive workflow. Automating it strengthens your
engineer's understanding of utilizing Canva templates and scheduling logic
without introducing complexity.

5.  CONTRACT REVIEWER & EXTRACTOR (ROI: 117%, Annual Savings: 3.5K

This is the appropriate next step for deeper document analysis. It stores
extracted data
in the business brain and expands your engineer's
experience with multi layer extraction, mapping, labeling patterns, and
structured outputs. It prepares the foundation for advanced integrations in
the next stage.

Tech Stack Progression

- Voice agent: not used yet
- Text agent SMS/WhatsApp): not used yet
- Business brain Supabase): utilized
- Omnichannel Chatwoot): not used yet

Stage 3
Develop the following agents during this stage:

6.  VENDOR FEEDBACK COLLECTOR (ROI: 36%, Annual Savings: 1K

This step introduces the voice agent component and activates the
omnichannel environment through Chatwoot. It strengthens your engineer's
ability to route communication, manage both voice and text interactions,

17

and connect responses back into the business brain. This is the gateway to
more advanced conversational agents.

7.  APPRAISAL PROCESS STEP 2 Tech Integration) (ROI: 16%, Annual

Savings: 0.5K
By now, Step 1 has been running for some time.
You have:

● Real data and observations from Step 1
● Business brain structure fully active
● Omnichannel running
● A more experienced AI Engineer who knows how to connect agents

across the tech stack

This is the moment where the process becomes fully integrated and
communication between agents, staff, and systems is introduced.
Omnichannel support will likely complement this step.

8.  VENDOR NURTURING AI Your RITA (ROI: 2,904%, Annual Savings: 87K

By this point the framework for handling both closed and open databases
should be defined, since this agent must follow clear rules for how leads are
tracked, updated, and re engaged.
Your AI Engineer now has experience with voice interactions, omnichannel
routing, and structured logging, so this is the natural next step where both
text and voice are used inside one agent.
This agent should be built using a stateful approach. The 10 AI Agent
Framework already includes the JSON state design pattern, which allows
the system to track each leads stage, remember progress, and return to the
correct point during future interactions. This will give the agent reliable
context throughout long term nurturing cycles.

Tech Stack Progression

- Voice agent: developed during this stage
- Text agent SMS/WhatsApp): developed during this stage
- Business brain Supabase): utilized
- Omnichannel Chatwoot): developed during this stage

18

10. PROPERTY SETTLEMENT EXTRACTOR (ROI: 37%, Annual Savings: 1K

Both tasks are simple because the email labeling logic is already in place.
This is also the right moment to add them so the information can flow
directly into the business brain. Doing this will significantly strengthen your
reporting capability.

11. BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AGENT High Qualitative ROI

With the business brain storing significant data and the omnichannel
environment fully operational, this agent begins to extract insights rather
than only automate tasks. Your engineer has now accumulated experience
across all parts of the stack, making this a natural step that combines
analytics, data ingestion, and advanced reasoning.

Tech Stack Progression

- Voice agent: N/A
- Text agent SMS/WhatsApp): utilized
- Business brain Supabase): utilized
- Omnichannel Chatwoot): utilized

Stage 5
Develop the following agents during this stage:

12. DATABASE IDEA GENERATOR High Qualitative ROI

Once most of the system is automated, this agent gathers insights from the
business brain and omnichannel conversations to enhance weekly idea
creation. At this point your engineer has full stack experience and can use
the existing ecosystem to its maximum potential.

Recommended AI Tech Stack

This section outlines the recommended technology stack that will support all AI
agents, automations, and business intelligence capabilities within the Harcourts
Ulverstone and Penguin ecosystem. The selections focus on reliability, cost
efficiency, scalability, and ease of integration across the current and future
architecture.

Voice Agent

Platform: Retell AI
Retell AI provides the fastest latency in the market, natural flow control,
interruption handling, and high accuracy for real conversations. It is ideal for any
calling workflows such as nurturing calls, reference collection, vendor feedback,
and appointment scheduling. The platform also provides robust analytics that help
track performance over time.

Text Agent

Platform: n8n with Redis Stateful Architecture)
All text based agents should be built entirely inside n8n with a Redis layer for
maintaining state.
This approach gives full control, unlimited executions when self hosted, and
significantly lower cost than SaaS AI automation tools.
Since you are currently on the cloud version of n8n, continue using it during early
development. Once the workflows mature and execution volume increases,
consider migrating to self hosting to reduce long term operational cost.
Keep your eye on total executions during development and testing cycles so you
can manage cost predictably.

AI Reasoning Models

Model: OpenAI 4.1 Mini
Most agents should use 4.1 Mini combined with the existing AI Agent Framework.
This delivers fast reasoning, low operational cost, and reliable performance across
extraction, structured reasoning, and state management.
The framework ensures consistent prompt structure, standard JSON state
patterns, and predictable agent behaviour across all use cases.

20

MCP Server

Platform: Custom MCP Server built inside n8n
Build your own MCP server within n8n and connect it directly to the Business
Brain.
This allows each AI agent to request data from a consistent and secure interface
without repeating integrations.
Any new tool integration such as Vault, accounting systems, calendars, or email
should also be exposed through MCP so every agent can reuse it.
This position creates a unified tool layer that prevents duplicated logic across
projects.

Business Brain

Platform: Supabase
Supabase is the ideal choice due to its speed, cost structure, scalability, and clean
user interface.
It supports structured data, file storage, authentication, and role based access,
which positions it as the central knowledge and data layer for all AI agents.
It also integrates seamlessly with n8n and MCP.

Omnichannel Communication

Platform: Chatwoot
After testing multiple platforms, Chatwoot provides the best balance of features
and cost.
It supports WhatsApp, SMS, email, web chat, and future channels while remaining
highly flexible.
It is also open source, simple to extend, and allows full routing control for both
agents and staff.
