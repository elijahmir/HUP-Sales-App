# What's New

## 🎨 Dashboard UI Enhancements (Feb 2026)

We've polished the dashboard for a more personalized and clear experience:

- **Personalized Welcome**: Now greets you by name (e.g., "Welcome back, Brad") instead of using your full email.
- **Clearer Terminology**: Renamed "Recent Appraisals" to "**Recent Front Sheets**" to better reflect the workflow.
- **Quick Actions**: Updated button labels to "**Upload Front Sheet**" and "**To VaultRE**" for clarity.
- **Improved Navigation**: Breadcrumbs now correctly display "**Front Sheet AI**".

## 🌗 Side-by-Side Contract Review

The Contract Review screen has been completely reimagined for efficiency:

- **Split View Layout**: Now displays the **Original Document** (Right) and **Digital Form** (Left) side-by-side.
- **Smart Scaling**: The digital form automatically scales down to fit the split view while maintaining full functionality.
- **Matched Heights**: Both panels utilize the full screen height with independent scrolling, ensuring a seamless comparison experience.

## 🛡️ Enhanced Security: Inactivity Timeout

To protect your sensitive data, we've implemented an intelligent inactivity timeout:

- **Auto-Logout**: Sessions automatically close after **15 minutes** of inactivity.
- **Smart Warning**: A warning modal appears **1 minute before** timeout, giving you a chance to stay logged in.
- **Activity Monitoring**: The system intelligently detects mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard usage to keep your session active while you work.
